# EXPF
A retro board or something like a dope todo list or trello or something.


Basically I am tired of pay-to-play retro boards.  This is my primary motivation for this project, aside from learning modern React frameworks and React itself.  

Outside of retro boards (I don't even like Agile), I feel like this could have a variety of uses; something like a cool todo list app (classic) or maybe a collaborative task-organizer of sorts.  Either way, the goal is semi-clear.

Brief todos / road map:
# Tier 1 Goals - Immediate goals (main functionality)
- Get editing comments to work
- Get liking comments to work
- Add sorting options
- Password-based boards
- Web Sockets on join
- I think I probably need to implement session stuff

# Tier 2 Goals - Eventualities that must occur for this to be useful beyond my own usage
- Users
- "Admin mode"

# Tech Stack
- DynamoDB for database
- NextJS 13 - App Router for client / server
- TailwindCSS 
- RadixUI
